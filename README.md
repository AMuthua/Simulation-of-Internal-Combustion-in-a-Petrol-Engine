# 🔥 Internal Combustion Engine Simulation  
This project simulates the operation of an **internal combustion petrol engine** in C++. The simulation models engine dynamics such as **piston movement, RPM changes, fuel combustion**, and speed control.  

🚀 **Goal**: Provide a simple yet interactive way to understand how a petrol engine works through a **C++ terminal-based simulation**.

## **🛠 Features**  
✔️ Simulates the **four-stroke cycle** (Intake, Compression, Power, Exhaust)  
✔️ Adjust **engine speed (RPM)** with interactive controls (`+` and `-` keys)  
✔️ Displays **real-time RPM and fuel consumption**  
✔️ Models **fuel injection, ignition timing, and piston movement**  
✔️ Smooth frame-rate control for a **realistic simulation experience**

## **📦 Requirements**  
### **1️⃣ System Requirements**  
🖥️ Works on **Windows, Linux, and macOS**  
🛠️ Requires a **C++ compiler** (e.g., g++, clang)  

### **2️⃣ Dependencies**  
- `ncurses.h` (For interactive terminal input handling)  
- `iostream`, `cmath`, `thread`, `chrono`  

To install dependencies:  
#### **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**  
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install libncurses5-dev
